Here’s a talk track you can read while clicking through the **Flow 3** demo (Patent Intelligence enriches the pack). It matches the Flow 3 app buttons: **Seed example secret sauce → Compile / Recompile → Run Patent Intelligence → Apply IP Delta → Tasks → Mark done → Compile / Recompile → Run Rubrics**.

## **Flow 3 Demo Talkscript (≈2–3 minutes)**

**0\) Setup (before first click)**

“Flow 2 was about diligence questions turning into an evidence plan.  
Flow 3 adds the IP layer: Patent Intelligence enriches the pack so the *differentiation becomes defensible*—not just persuasive.”

**(Open DevTools → Console)**

“I’ll keep the console open so you can see the PI scan and the downstream updates.”

---

## **1\) Start from a Decision Pack with “secret sauce” claims**

**Click: *Seed example secret sauce*** (if it isn’t already seeded)

“Here are a few ‘secret sauce’ hypotheses: rubric-gated underwriting, evidence linkage, change-triggered recompiles.  
In reality these are what founders say in conversations—but they’re not yet claim hooks.”

Point at the text area:

“This is the input boundary: a set of candidate differentiators.”

**Click: *Compile / Recompile***

“Now we compile a baseline Decision Pack. Notice the IP section is still basically empty—because we haven’t mapped these claims to a prior-art landscape yet.”

---

## **2\) Run Patent Intelligence to generate an IP Delta Packet**

**Click: *Run Patent Intelligence***

“Now Patent Intelligence runs a scan—here it’s mocked—against a prior-art pool for this domain.  
The goal is not to ‘find a patent’—it’s to produce an underwriting-friendly *IP delta packet*.”

Point to the Delta Packet:

“For each claim hook candidate, it identifies the closest adjacency, assigns an ‘adjacency risk’, proposes a novelty delta, flags design-around risk, and recommends an action: file, publish defensively, or hold.”

Optional one-liner:

“This turns ‘secret sauce’ into ‘defensible differentiation’—or tells you it’s too crowded.”

---

## **3\) Convert IP Delta → Workflow OS tasks (actionable plan)**

**Click: *Apply IP Delta → Tasks***

“Now Workflow OS turns the IP delta into tasks.  
This is critical: IP doesn’t live as a PDF. It becomes a set of concrete decisions and receipts.”

Point at task list:

“You’ll see tasks like: draft a novelty delta memo, create picket-fence variants, record file/publish/hold decisions, and map design-arounds.”

Also point at Evidence Vault:

“The system also drops a ‘delta receipt’ into the evidence vault—so the pack can cite where the IP update came from.”

---

## **4\) Produce receipts (evidence) by completing tasks**

**Click: *Mark done*** on 2–3 tasks (recommend: novelty memo \+ one action decision \+ one design-around map)  
Suggested order:

* “Draft 1-page novelty delta memo”  
* “File provisional / Defensive publication decision record for hook CH1”  
* “Map design-around risks for CH1”

As you click:

“Each completed task generates an evidence object—again structured and linkable—so the IP story is audit-friendly.”

---

## **5\) Recompile the Decision Pack with the enriched IP layer**

**Click: *Compile / Recompile***

“Now we recompile.  
The Decision Pack IP section is now populated: it has the delta summary, the hook-by-hook action plan, and linked receipts.”

Point at IP section:

“This is what makes it forwardable: it’s not ‘we think this is novel.’  
It’s ‘here’s the delta, here’s the risk, here’s the action, here are the receipts.’”

---

## **6\) Run IP-aware rubrics to assess underwritability**

**Click: *Run Rubrics***

“Now we run the IP-aware gate.  
It scores whether we have: claim hooks, novelty delta computation, design-around bounded, and an action plan.”

Point to score/gate:

“If it fails, it fails for specific reasons—missing action records, missing design-around map, or thin hooks—so the next tasks are obvious.”

---

## **7\) Close (what Flow 3 proves)**

“Flow 3 shows the difference between ‘IP as an afterthought’ and ‘IP as part of underwriting.’  
Patent Intelligence doesn’t just search; it *enriches the Decision Pack* with novelty deltas, design-around risk, and explicit file/publish/hold choices—so the differentiation is defensible and the artifact stays forwardable.”

### **Optional one-liners depending on audience**

**If speaking to investors:**

“This is why the pack is underwritable: it answers ‘can they defend this?’ with structured receipts, not vibes.”

**If speaking to attorneys/patent agents:**

“This doesn’t replace counsel—it pre-structures the inputs and deltas so counsel time is spent on the right claim hooks.”

**If someone asks why “publish defensively” appears:**

“Because sometimes the right move is to block a fast follower or create prior art—without paying the full cost of filing everything.”

If you want, I can also generate a **30–60s ultra-short** version that hits only the “hook → delta → action → receipts → recompile” spine.
