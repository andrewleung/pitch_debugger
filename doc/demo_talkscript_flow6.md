## **Flow 6 Demo Talkscript (≈2–3 minutes) — Two-track output (Investor Pack vs Attorney Pack)**

**0\) Setup (before first click)**

“Flow 6 solves a common real-world tension: the thing that makes your company defensible is often the thing you *can’t* safely share in an investor-forwardable packet.  
So we compile from one canonical Decision Pack into two tracks: an **Investor Pack** that’s safe and forwardable, and an **Attorney Pack** that’s deep enough to draft and prosecute.”

**(Open DevTools → Console)**

“I’ll keep the console open so you can see the compiler applying disclosure policy and generating both outputs.”

---

## **1\) Start from a single canonical source of truth**

**Click: *Seed realistic canonical data***

“This left side is the canonical pack—single source of truth: problem, ICP, secret sauce hypotheses, and IP layer inputs.”

Point at the canonical fields:

“Notice the secret sauce area allows marking lines as **\[SENSITIVE\]**.  
That’s not cosmetic—it’s a policy tag the compiler uses.”

---

## **2\) Run gates (optional but useful)**

**Click: *Run Underwritable Gates***

“Before we compile, we run underwritable gates.  
This tells us whether the artifact is in a state that can be forwarded, and it generates tasks if it’s not.”

If tasks appear:

“If it fails, it doesn’t just complain—it produces tasks that become receipts.”

---

## **3\) Add attorney-only details (simulate what founders normally hesitate to share)**

**Click: *Add sensitive lines***

“Now I’m adding a few attorney-only details: claim-hook variants and novelty deltas.  
Watch the ‘Sensitive items’ counter go up.”

“This is normal: the deeper you get into defensibility, the more you risk leaking.”

---

## **4\) Compile into two tracks**

**Click: *Compile Two-Track Packs***

“Now the compiler produces two different views from the same canonical store.”

---

## **5\) Show the Investor Pack (safe \+ forwardable)**

(Stay on **Investor Pack** tab)

“This is the Investor Pack: concise narrative, investor framing, risk summary, evidence index, and gate summary.”

Point at secret sauce lines:

“Here’s the key behavior: sensitive lines are either **withheld** or **redacted** based on disclosure policy.  
So the pack stays forwardable without leaking the magic.”

One-liner:

“Investor Pack optimizes for *underwritability* and *shareability*.”

---

## **6\) Switch to Attorney Pack (deep drafting inputs)**

**Click: *Attorney Pack* tab**

“Now the Attorney Pack: this is privileged and deep. It includes full secret sauce, claim hooks, novelty delta notes, design-around risks, and drafting inputs.”

Point at drafting inputs:

“This is where Patent Intelligence outputs actually become useful—because counsel can immediately see what to draft, what embodiments matter, and what claims to explore.”

One-liner:

“Attorney Pack optimizes for *defensibility* and *draftability*.”

---

## **7\) Show the Diff (why two tracks matter)**

Point to **Diff** panel:

“And the Diff makes it explicit what was withheld or redacted from the investor track.  
That auditability is important: you can prove you’re being disciplined about disclosure—not arbitrary.”

---

## **8\) Demonstrate policy control in real time**

**Change disclosure policy** dropdown (Strict → Balanced)

“Now I’ll loosen the policy from ‘strict’ to ‘balanced.’ This means the investor pack gets redacted summaries instead of hard withholding.”

**Click: *Compile Two-Track Packs***

“Recompile—and you can see the investor view becomes more informative, without revealing claim-critical detail.”

“This is the practical knob founders need as conversations progress.”

---

## **Close (what Flow 6 proves)**

“Flow 6 proves we can keep one canonical truth, but produce different artifacts for different audiences.  
Investors get something safe and forwardable. Attorneys get something actionable for drafting.  
And both stay consistent because they compile from the same source—with explicit policy and an auditable diff.”

### **Optional punchline (if speaking to investors)**

“You’re not underwriting a deck. You’re underwriting a controlled artifact—with a safe version for sharing and a deep version for defensibility.”

### **Optional punchline (if speaking to attorneys)**

“You’re not starting from a blank intake. You’re starting from structured hooks, deltas, and design-around notes—already organized.”

If you want, I can also produce a **60-second** and **30-second** version of this script for tighter demo windows.
